# MCF-multtest
Implementation of the MCF-based large-scale multiple discrete testing method, and codes for the paper:

Xiaoyu Dai, Nan Lin, Daofeng Li, Ting Wang. A non-randomized procedure for heterogeneous discrete multiple testing based on randomized tests.

* BT.R: simulations of Binomial test.
* Condition_check.R: simulations to graphically validate condition 3.1.
* FET.R: simulations of Fishers Exact Test.
* FNR_bound: derive FNR and its bound described in Theorem 2.
* MCF.cpp: cpp code for fast computing MCF values.
* methy_main.R: DMR detection and follow-up analysis.
* Methy.R: load and pre-process raw WGBS data.
* MT.R: MCF-based multiple testing procedure.
* pi0_rep.R: simulations to measure accuracy of pi0 estimator.
* validation.R: simulations to numerically validate condition 3.1.
